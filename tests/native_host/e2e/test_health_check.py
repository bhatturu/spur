"""E2E tests for node health checks (spur#801).

The controller submits each configured check as a real job that requests its
node exclusively, so it runs only when the node is idle. A non-zero exit (or a
timeout) drains the node with the check as the reason — a sticky drain the
operator recovers, like Slurm's failed ``HealthCheckProgram``. A passing check
leaves the node schedulable. Configured via ``[[health.checks]]``.
